INSTRUCTIONS

obfuscator.lua contains main program. obfuscate(code) returns obfuscated code. 
	possible issues: 
		local x = 1; local table = {x=1}; print table["x"]
		here 'x' will be renamed but "x" not, causing error. table.x will be renamed correctly though.

obfuscated_obfuscator.lua contains obfuscated version of obfuscator.lua.
