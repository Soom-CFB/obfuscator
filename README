INSTRUCTIONS
modify last lines inside mod lua file for your own a_in.lua (original) and a_out.lua file (obfuscated)

0. use local variables all the time in your code, only use globals if absolutely necessary. all the local variables are affected by "clarity".
1.follow this guideline with the structs a = {...} : 
a = {b=c,d=e, function(f)  g ... } will work, so simple variables first, nested pure functions later is ok. 
if you do function first it will assume you exited struct so stuff like b=c afterwards will get replaced too with v___ = v____ this will then cause execution errors!
2. dont use same variable name for variable thats local and global
